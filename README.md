Project: Online services for newcomers
This project aims to develop a platform that will facilitate the settlement of newcomers in Alberta in order to improve the quality of services and guaranty the equity access of these services.
The solution is currently considered by La Francophonie Canadienne Plurielle (FRAP). I had the opportunity of contributing to specify the global solution, and it includes several functionalities. 
As part of the final project with ComIT, I will focus on the Agenda Management which will consist of making an appointment online depending on newcomerâ€™s need.
